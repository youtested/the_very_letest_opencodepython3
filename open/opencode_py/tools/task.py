"""Task tool: launch a sub-agent in its own session (mirrors opencode's task).

The tool's run() is resolved lazily from the Registry: the owning AgentLoop
installs itself as `registry.task_spawner` at construction time, so the tool
works headless (no spawner -> helpful error) and nests naturally (sub-agents
get their own registry with the same lazy hook).
