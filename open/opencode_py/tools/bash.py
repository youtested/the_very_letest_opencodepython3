    """Kill the shell AND every process it spawned.

    The shell is started as a new session/process-group leader, so background
    grandchildren (`sleep 1000 &`) live in the same group as the shell; a bare
    `proc.kill()` only signals the shell PID and leaks the children, which keep
    holding the stdout pipe and the cwd hostage. Killing the group reaps them.

    ``pgid`` should be the shell's process-group id captured while the shell
    was still alive. Passing it by value matters: by the time we clean up, the
    shell PID is often already gone (the command finished), but its group id
    still exists as long as a stray background child keeps a membership — and
    `os.getpgid(proc.pid)` would then fail, losing the handle on that group.
    Fall back to resolving it live only when no pgid was given.

    Children that daemonize into their own session (`setsid`, ...) escape the
    shell's group. On Linux we catch those that are still direct children of
    the live shell (the timeout/interrupt paths) by scanning /proc by
    parentage; a fully double-forked daemon already reparented to init is out
    of scope. That sweep is skipped when the shell has already exited — its
    children have been reparented and nothing is left to catch, and killing the
    process group already handled any non-daemonized strays. Scanning /proc
    opens a file per process and is measurable overhead on every command, so
    the common (clean-exit) path must not pay it.

    Returns ``(raw, capped, end)`` where ``end`` is one of:

    - ``"shell_exited"`` — the main shell terminated (poll() non-None).
      This is the honest end of the command. The stdout pipe may still be open
      because a stray background child inherited it; we do NOT wait for that
      pipe's EOF, and we drain only what is already buffered. It is the
      caller's job to reap the group so the stray child dies too.
    - ``"eof"`` — the pipe reached EOF (every writer closed it).
    - ``"timeout"`` — the deadline was hit before the command finished.
    - ``"interrupted"`` — ``is_interrupted()`` became true mid-command.

    Uses the raw fd (not the buffered pipe object, whose internal buffer can
    hold data `select` doesn't see) so nothing gets stuck. The fd is set
    non-blocking so EOF (``os.read`` -> ``b""``) is detectable even while a
